Answer:
Graceful degradation and service workers both aim to enhance web user experience, though in different ways. Graceful degradation ensures that a website remains functional on older or less capable browsers, providing a basic but accessible experience even if advanced features are not supported. Service workers, on the other hand, improve performance and reliability on modern browsers by enabling offline access, caching resources, and handling background synchronization. Together, they complement each other by ensuring that websites perform well on modern browsers with service workers while still being usable on older browsers, achieving a balance between advanced features and broad accessibility.
